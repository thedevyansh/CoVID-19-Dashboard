## What is it?

This repo represents the COVID-19 Dashboard (in the form of graphs), which displays the statistics of positive, hospitalized, in ICU, deaths etc. One can easily check the number of cases of any particular day which is updated everyday. Morover, there's a button provided to another webpage where the New York Times information can be checked by searching any keyword along with optional start and end date.

Check [NYTimes](https://github.com/thedevyansh/nytimes/) for that repo!
